## Unreleased
### Added

* When looking for a glyph in the fallback fonts, don't discard
  (destroy/unload) the fonts that did not contain the glyph. This
  improves performance massively when loading lots of glyphs that does
  not exist in the primary font, or in the first fallback font(s).


### Changed

* `fcft_clone()` was not thread safe
* `fcft_size_adjust()` was not thread safe
* `fcft_destroy` was not thread safe
